# HeronsFormula
1) To star You should import library "math". Deatail information is here -> https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html
2) You enter required data.
2) You're finding P by this formula -> P = (a + b + c) / 2
3) The last step is findig S by Heron's formula using math library -> S = math.sqrt(P * (P - a) * (P - b) * (P - c))
4) That's the end, You finally found S!ðŸ¥³

ALSO YOU CAN SEE ANOTHER OPTION IN THE BOTTOM

The usual formula for finding the area of triangle
1) You enter required data.
2) You're finding P by this formula -> P = (a + b + c) / 2
3) The last step is findig S by Heron's formula => S = (P * (P - a) * (P - b) * (P - c)) ** 0.5
4) Congratulation! That's It!ðŸ¥³
